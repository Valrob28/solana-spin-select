    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do I start playing the Crypto Lottery?",
        answer: "Simply connect your Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare), select 5 numbers from 1-49, and purchase your tickets for 0.02 SOL each. It's that easy!"
      },
      {
        question: "What wallets are supported?",
        answer: "We support all major Solana wallets including Phantom, Solflare, and any wallet compatible with the Solana wallet adapter."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need SOL to play?",
        answer: "Yes, you need SOL (Solana's native token) to purchase lottery tickets. Each ticket costs 0.02 SOL plus minimal network fees."
      }

    category: "Tickets & Pricing",
    icon: DollarSign,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How much do tickets cost?",
        answer: "Individual tickets cost 0.02 SOL each. We offer bulk discounts up to 40% off for larger purchases (5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 tickets)."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any additional fees?",
        answer: "No hidden fees! You only pay the ticket price plus standard Solana network transaction fees (typically less than $0.01)."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I buy multiple tickets with different numbers?",
        answer: "Currently, bulk purchases use the same set of numbers. To play different number combinations, you'll need to make separate ticket purchases."
      }

  {
    category: "Draws & Fairness",
    icon: Shield,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How are the draws conducted?",
        answer: "All draws use Solana's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) technology, ensuring complete transparency and fairness. Results are permanently recorded on the blockchain."
      },
      {
        question: "When do draws happen?",
        answer: "Draws are scheduled regularly. Check the Draw History section for upcoming draw dates and past results."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I verify the fairness of draws?",
        answer: "Every draw includes a VRF proof link that allows you to verify the randomness on the Solana blockchain. This ensures no one can manipulate the results."
      }

  {
    category: "Prizes & Payouts",
    icon: Trophy,
    questions: [
      {

      },
      {
        question: "How are prizes distributed?",
        answer: "Digital prizes and cash are automatically sent to your wallet via smart contract. Physical prizes require identity verification and shipping arrangements."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do I have to claim my prize?",
        answer: "You have 30 days from the draw date to claim your prize. Digital prizes are automatically distributed, but physical prizes require active claiming."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there taxes on winnings?",
        answer: "Tax obligations vary by jurisdiction. You are responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes on your winnings according to your local laws."

    category: "Technical & Security",
    icon: Clock,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is my wallet safe?",
        answer: "Yes! We only request permission for ticket purchases. Your private keys remain in your wallet and are never shared with our platform."
      },
      {
        question: "What if my transaction fails?",
        answer: "If a transaction fails, your SOL will remain in your wallet. Common causes include insufficient funds or network congestion. Simply try again."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I play from any country?",
        answer: "Crypto Lottery is available globally except in restricted jurisdictions. You must be 18+ or the legal gambling age in your location."
